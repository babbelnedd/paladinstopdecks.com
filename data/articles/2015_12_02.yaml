    Much Blood, toil, tears, and sweat later we are here with <a href="/">Paladins Top Decks</a>.
    I couldn't be more proud to finally release the first version. We've tried to serve you as soon as possible with the content you deserve!
    We keep updating the site on a daily basis - that means: when the site is offline just try it again in a moment.

    Since we are still in an early release cycle it could happen that there will be a bug or two. Just <a href="https://twitter.com/paladinstopdeck">tweet us</a> or <a href="/contact">write an email</a>.
    The same obviously applies for feature requests or any questions you might have.
