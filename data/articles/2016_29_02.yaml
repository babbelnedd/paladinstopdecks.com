  The sniper, loved by many, hated by many more. No FPS is safe from the role's extensive grasp. Even TF2 and Overwatch, two of the most wacky shooters out there, have a definitive sniper role in them. But does a sniper belong in Paladins?

  Kinessa is her name. From what we've gathered, she is the quintessential sniper. Stay far away and shoot stuff with the help of your scope. Her playstyle seems pretty obvious. Stay far far back - futher back than any Cassie - and click on heads.

  If someone asks if there should be a sniper in Paladins, chances are most people will say "Sure, why not?" Surprisingly, that's a valid point. As long as Hi-Rez include viable counters to her (Skye's smoke screen, literally any shield) then she will be kept in check, no?

  "No" someone could respond, "Just look at the sniper in TF2!" For those who don't know, at high level play in TF2, all strategy is revolved around the sniper (avoiding him or killing him). In essence, the sniper role has no skillcap. This lets a sniper hold down anything within their line of sight indefinitely (if they're good enough). This kind of situation is one we certainly wouldn't like in Paladins, and so a fair few people are against Kinessa entering the Realm.

  I spoke to UndeadPilot, a player for NN esports, an EU team. "I'm coming from a moba background so in my opinion no, however the game isn't just a moba, but also a fps and in a fps a sniper is needed."

  It seems a sniper wouldn't be great on glacier keep (a fan favourite map), where the map in general is much more enclosed, unfortunately for her.

  So that's some arguements for and against a sniper coming to Paladins. Do you agree with UndeadPilot or any of the points in the article? Tell us in the comments!
