    Hello everyone, welcome to this analytical breakdown of patch 0.12. As you guys probably know it is a big change done to Paladins.
    A lot of questions came up. But is it the Paladins 2.0 everyone talked about?
  </p>

  <p>
    Before I start I want you guys to know that this is just my own opinion that doesn't have to reflect yours. I would like to hear your feedback and discuss different stand points.
    I won't go into to much detail on changes. I recommend that you read the <a href="http://forums.paladins.com/showthread.php?3450-The-Chicken-Patch-Notes-Closed-Beta-12-21st-Jan-2016">patch notes</a> - if you haven't yet.

  <h3>New Gamemodes</h3>
  <p>
    The first, of the two, new gamemodes is Payload which is a close quarters team of five versus mode. Here one team has to defend and the other needs to push an engine into the enemy base.

      <p>
        In my opinion, Payload will be the second most played mode in Paladins. It in some ways has striking similarities to the Joust gamemode in Smite.
        Payload is everything that Siege just isn't. It is a fast paced, team fight oriented mode, that still needs a fair amount of strategy to get and keep the upper hand.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Will it be a competitive mode?</strong></p>
      <p>
        I think it will have it fair chance at competitive play. Payload will play a lot different then what we know from Siege. As an example, Siege is on big maps with huge points to fight over. Payload is one constant teamfight on a much smaller map.
        After all I think Payload is going to rise as an competitive mode just like Siege. The only problem will be the balancing issue between attacking and defending team. I'll leave that to Hi-Rez to balance.

  <p>The second gamemode is Survival an 5 versus 5 team fight only gamemode that plays on the two Siege maps. To insure the fight there is fog added that damages you on touch, it will slowly move to one of the three map points.</p>

  <p><strong>What does the gamemode actually offer?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Team fights. It's designed to be a huge teamfight and exactly that is what it does. No secondary objectives. It's just which team can kill the other team faster. That's okay, it'll still be funny and still see play by a lot of people, don't get me wrong, I will play it too.
  </p>


  <p><strong>Will it be a competitive mode?</strong></p>
  <p>No of course not. All you do in that gamemode is fighting there is no in-depth to it, no special strategy just killing. It's like the Arena mode in smite so it will most likely have some tournaments but nothing big. I mean its not even designed to be like that why would they force it to be competitive?


  <h3>General changes</h3>
  <p>Now let's start with the big changes right here, now to calm you all down it's the same game. It's the same formula BUT they have changed the way that formula works quite a lot.</p>

  <div class=row>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6" style="padding-top:30px;">
      <p><strong>Beacons</strong></p>
      <p>
        Respawn beacons will be add to all modes except Survival. The beacon will work as a teleport out of your base and into the set location you put it. If found, the enemy team can destroy your beacon.
      </p>
      <p>
      The beacons add a whole new level of strategy because now you have to worry about where the enemy team is coming from. Otherwise they will have an pretty big advantage when returning to the fight. Now you can keep on fighting over one point, after you lost a team fight, instead of just giving it away. Beacons are a complete new element that needs to adapt into your strategy. Whether you play with or against it.</p>

      <p>Next up is something that fits with the beacon perfect, the stealth grass. These high bushes will now be on every map, players that stand inside of them will not be seen until they take action.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
      <div class="youtube-wrapper top40 bottom40">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y78Y2UH5uR4?hd=1&showinfo=0&modestbranding=0&color=white&rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <i class=clearfix></i>

  <p>What that does for you is an entire new level of tactics. It gives you the ability to gank people. You can hide when you need to regenerate. You can lay down beacons in there and a lot more. You better start looking in those bushes.</p>

  <p>
    Now lets start with the big changes that actually effect gameplay. First off with player vision changes. You don't longer see what your teammates see. Shooting doesn't reveal you either.<br>
    Why is that such an drastic change you ask? Let me explain. Things like Skye and Evie will have an way easier way of sneaking in and out of the fight if you don't notice them. Team communication will have to change a lot because now you have to shout out positions of the enemy. Most teams will have to adjust their comms if they want to stay viable.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Ultimates</strong>, yes all champions have received a fourth skill, an ultimate. Most of these ultimates are pretty big <abrr title="Area of Effect">AoEs</abbr>. They will most likely help gain and keep control over the enemy team. <br>
    I like the <em>damage dealt</em> / <em>damage taken</em> system to charge up the ultimate. It works as a reward for both - a good carry and a good support. An issue I see is: A well placed ult will recharge their cooldown immediately. Hi-Rez will most likely change that next patch so there is nothing to worry about.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Random Number Generators</strong></p>
  <p>
    Finally the last thing I want to talk about is the change Hi-Rez made to the card system. Let's just skip the crafting system and go right into RNG and why it's no problem at all.
    Yes you read that correct I think it is not a problem at all. People should get used to it sooner rather then later.
    To understand my point first of all you will have to understand why Hi-Rez keeps adding RNG to the game. They add RNG to not have their game boring and repetitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Earlier everyone just got the same exact cards for their champ every single game.
    Whether you agree with me or not playing the same champion five games in a row with the same cards is exhausting. I just didn't want to play anymore, at least not that champ.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now what does that mean for Hi-Rez? Newer players, that only have good cards for one champ will soon lose their interest in the game. This stops new players from coming in the game and slowly lead the game to die. Hi-Rez knows that, Hi-Rez doesn't want that and I can imagine that you don't want that either.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How do we keep Paladins alive?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Just the way Hi-Rez did it, by making every game an unique but still controllable experience. This keeps the game interesting enough to get new players into it. That's pretty much what everybody wants in this game right? So I completely understand Hi-Rez decision.
    “But what about the competitiveness in this game? Doesn't RNG destroy that, if you have to depend on luck to get good cards?”  Yes I agree RNG is always a big problem with competitiveness in games. Everything that you can't control is in fact a problem but Hi-Rez even thought about that as well.
    First of all you get 2 out of 3 cards you chose so the chance that you get a card that you actually want is pretty high. What they also did is re-adjust the strength of every single card in every card rarity. That way, every single card in a rarity for every champ is just as potent as any other card in that rarity. That means even if you don't get one of the three cards the other one is just as strong.<br>
    That's the reason why they removed so many cards, to adjust the rarity strength they did a pretty good job with it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes I know there still are potent OP cards in the game which you don't want the enemy to draw. That's where the card ban system comes in, if you don't want an enemy champ to have a certain card just have it in your deck. Both of you won't get it and you will now be able to chose from two just as strong cards. That way you can ban an OP card from the enemy deck on each rarity.
    Of course this system is one that you will have to get used to and yes It makes deck building way more complex. Now instead of figuring out one way to play a certain champ and sticking to it you will have to figure out which cards will all do the thing you want at that level.  Also you will have to check what cards you don't want your enemy to get.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion the RNG system doesn't only make the game go on more fluent. It also gives it more variety and make every game an unique experience. RNG doesn't kill competitiveness, instead it does the exact opposite. It makes the game more competitive and complex by making you think about what you're doing instead of just going one way and running with it.
  </p>

  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
  <p>
    After all I must say this patch did bring a lot of good changes to Paladins. It actually is what most people said: Paladins 2.0.
