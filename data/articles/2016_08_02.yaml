  <h2>Deckbuilder</h2>

  <p>
    We have reworked the deckbuilder from scratch. You have to add five cards for each deck, one from each tier.
    If you want to post multiple decks you'll have to create multiple decks.
    But if you want to acknowledge certain cards that could be replaced with other cards, you can use the Substitution Tool.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Text Editor got simplified, but we think it actually has improved. We have removed some formatting options to keep some consistence between guides.
  </p>

  <p>
    As said earlier, to create a deck you just have to add 5 cards.
    To be exact, you can't even add a description or substitutions until the deck is created.
    Once the deck is created, you will be redirected to a page where you can update the guide.
    In other words: you can add a description and substitutions once your deck is created.
  </p>

  <h2>Closed Beta 14</h2>

  <p>
    As you most likely already know, the upcoming patch will change the deck building process quite a bit.
    However, you'll still build a deck for each match.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will wait a bit and decide later if we want to add a level-guide for cards decks. Your opinion is welcome; leave a comment or send us a Tweet.

    Another feature we've thought about is a matchup section for decks.
    Build a Cassie Deck, for example, and explain how a matchup versus another champion would look.
