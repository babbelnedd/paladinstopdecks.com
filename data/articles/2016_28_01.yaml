    We are currently looking for people interested in writing Paladins Top Decks. When you think you can write: let us know!
  </p>
  <p>
    It would be nice if you would already have some experience in this context - but you don't have to. If you do so although,
    don't miss to put it in the application. We would like to know who you are and why you want to write for Top Decks. <br>
    Don't forget to mention what you would like to write about.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are looking forward hearing from you!
