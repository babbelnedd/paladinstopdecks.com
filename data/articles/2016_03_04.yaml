  <p>Paladins boasts 4 different game modes: Capture-and-Siege, Capture-only, Survival and Payload. Which one is best for competitive gameplay?</p>
  <p>So how about Capture-Only?  I myself like it. The game mode revolves more around skirmishing / team fighting than other modes. But, Elvenpath from the team NoElves who won the recent SunkenCitySalt tournament does not. He says: “Well, I am more of an old-school guy who doesn't like new stuff etc. So I don't find anything but Capture-and-Siege viable for competitive play. Capture-Only doesn't have main aspects: gates and base onslaught, which I find integral to a well-rounded game mode in this game.” He sums it up pretty well. It’s an enjoyable game mode, but it doesn't test every aspect of a player during the course of the match.</p>
  <p>How about Payload? To be blunt, Payload is rough. The only Payload map for was ported from Global Agenda. The overtime allows you to use staggered death timers to extend the game by a good 2-3 minutes during overtime. The size of buildings and shape of the map doesn’t fit the range at which most of this game plays out at. Along with that, there are a large number of areas where you can push the Payload effectively for free. And there are areas which are heavy chokepoints where you have a 1-2 minutes skirmish over pushing the Payload. This creates a bumpy play style for the map, perhaps making playing Payload start to feel repetitive.</p>
  <p>Survival is the second most played game mode after Capture-and-Siege. While it’s popular in pubs, competitive players dislike it. Essentially Survival is a battle to use your shields and health regenerating abilities as late as possible while avoiding fighting for as long as possible. Torpedo Gaming were even able to win a game of survival in a previous patch by doing 0 damage to enemies, just by using shields effectively. A game mode like that is one I, among others, would not like to see played competitively. It is of course worth noting its casual gameplay is certainly enjoyable.</p>
  <p>Now we move to the Classic. The one and only Capture-and-Siege. This was originally the only game mode in the game up until they introduced Capture-Only and Siege-Only in CB10. Currently it is the game mode played in competitive. It seems most players are happy for it to stay that way, because while some other modes such as Capture-Only aren't particularly bad, Capture-and-Siege is the best game mode. It tests each team’s ability to do everything in the game. That could be pushing with the Siege engine, team fighting around points or defending your gates. It’s also good to note that every map is designed for Capture-and-Siege, with no maps dedicated to Capture-only or Siege-only.</p>
  <p>It seems my unabated support for Capture-Only is in vain. Capture-and-Siege is the preferred game mode for competitive play.  Perhaps with more champions and more balancing, the other game modes will begin to see play in the competitive scene.</p>
