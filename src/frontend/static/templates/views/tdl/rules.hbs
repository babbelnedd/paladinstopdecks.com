        <h2>1. General</h2>
        <p>
            The league administration has the right to decide outside or even against the rulebook in special cases to

        </p>

        <h3>1.1.</h3>
        <p>
            Every team must read, understand and agree to the rules for participation in the Pro League (the "Rules").
            The team captain (as defined in Section 3.2) will be responsible for accepting and agreeing
            to the rules on behalf of the entire team's roster. Thereafter, each player is expected and required
            to abide by the Rules, and any failure to follow them will result in punitive measures, including but not

            to the full extent of the rules available.<br>

            not
            be allowed).
        </p>
